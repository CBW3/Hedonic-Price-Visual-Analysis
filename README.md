# Hedonic-Price-Visual-Analysis
I utilize Tableau to perform exploratory visual data analysis on a large dataset pertaining to AirBnB listings.

The dataset is extremely large. The dataset was derived via web-scaping from the AirBnB platform.

The data contains a ton of information pertaining to rental properties available in the calender year 2016 & 2017.

For this excercise, I created an inner join on the CSV files to aggregate them together.

Likewise, I created a handful of different visualizations that help describe hedonic price variation.
